                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Hello, I am Kaylana Christerfield. I am a  student in 9th grade at southeastern Highschool. 
                        For the last 3 months I’ve been learning HTML and CSS with Journi. During those months we had made 3 finish projects. 
                        Working with journi was the first step to my ultimate goal of becoming a game developer.

            <h3>Why game development?</h3>
                <p>
                    I wanted to be a game developer for awhile now. I always had a creative mind and being a game developer can help me express that creativity. 
                    Another reason why I want to get into the game industry is so I can add more POC queer reprsentives to media.  
                    I think it would be amazing to see queer characters besides white gay males. I still have a bit of the way to go but i won't stop till i get there.

            <h1>Where do you see youself in the future?</h1>
                <p> In 2 years I  see myself as a Junior in high school working on prgessing my knowledge of code. 
                    In 5 years i see myself making my first game. I’m not sure i advanced it will be but I am confident that over the next 5 years I will dedicate my time to learning  want I need to make it. 
                    There are many programs like journi and self teaching websites that i can join th uther my website. It seems like the hardest part will be finding an artist to work with me.
